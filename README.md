# Typescript Quirks
Typescript is an incredible tool for writing type safe readable code. However, it comes with some interesting quirks!

This repository is here to provide a clear run down of some of the more popular quirks in Ts so you can get more familiar with the language you love <3


## Dev Notes:
1. Some of the examples cannot be out of the box as they're intended to show that certain code does not work
2. For all other samples (or if you alter existing ones to play around) you can run the code using the vs code task included in the repo
